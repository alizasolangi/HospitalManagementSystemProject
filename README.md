🏥 Hospital Queue Management System

The Hospital Queue Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to streamline hospital operations by managing patients and doctors efficiently.
The system provides a simple and intuitive interface built with Java Swing and uses a Queue data structure to ensure that patients are treated in the order they arrive (FIFO – First In, First Out).

It allows hospital staff to add, update, and view patient and doctor details, improving workflow efficiency and patient care through digital management instead of manual record-keeping.

🔧 Features

🧍‍♂️ Patient Management: Add, update, and view patient details such as ID, Name, Age, Disease, and Treatment Status.

👨‍⚕️ Doctor Management: Add, edit, or delete doctor information (ID, Name, Contact No, Availability).

⏱️ Queue System: Automatically manages patients in a FIFO order to ensure fair and efficient treatment.

🩺 Treat Next Patient: Assigns a doctor to the next patient in the queue and removes them after treatment.

🚪 Exit Option: Allows safe and proper closing of the application.

The project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures (Queue) concepts in real-world problem-solving.
It’s an excellent example of how Java Swing and event-driven programming can be used to build a practical and user-friendly hospital management tool.

This system is ideal for small to medium-sized clinics or hospitals that need a digital solution to manage patients efficiently and reduce waiting time.
